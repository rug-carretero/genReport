    I found that you cannot just check for the word "mail" inside a URL to determine whether it is a mailing list.
    What I found in PDFBOX project is that a URL is a mailing list if:
    1. It contains the word "mail" inside its domain or subdomain(s), or
    2. It contains "mailinglists" and "mail-lists" inside its path and/or page
    The problem with point 2 is that there can also be other combinations such as "mailing-lists" or "maillists".
    We don't now for sure how many of them can be found.
    THe reason why we cannot search for "mail" word inside the URL path and/or page is that there are exceptions.
    For example, in the issue PDFBOX-1674 there is an autogenerated response with the URL "http://www.kb.nl/email"
    which in fact is a form to send an email to someone and it not a mailing list.
